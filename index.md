*Wyclif's Dust* is a forthcoming book by [David Hugh-Jones](author.md).

It gives a new interpretation of the history of the West, from the
invention of the printing press to the present day.

> Western nations suffer from severe social problems, rising populism and
> declining trust. These problems did not come from nowhere: they have roots in
> the dramatic cultural changes of the late twentieth century. To understand them,
> we must rethink our own history. The West did not just develop good institutions
> and economic growth: it also created a uniquely powerful culture. By reanalysing
> the rise of the West through a cultural prism, using ideas from the new science
> of cultural evolution, Wyclif's Dust shows where modern liberalism went wrong, 
> and how to repair it.
