*Wyclif's Dust* is a book of history. It reinterprets the history of the West, 
from the invention of the printing press to the present day.

> Western nations suffer from severe social problems, rising populism and
> declining trust. These problems did not come from nowhere: they have roots in
> the dramatic cultural changes of the late twentieth century. To understand them,
> we must rethink our own history. The West did not just develop good institutions
> and economic growth: it also created a uniquely powerful culture. By reanalysing
> the rise of the West through a cultural prism, using ideas from the new science
> of cultural evolution, **Wyclif's Dust** shows where modern liberalism went wrong, 
> and how to repair it.
