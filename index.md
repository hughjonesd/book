**Wyclif's Dust: Western Cultures from the Printing Press to the Present** 
reinterprets the history of the West, 
from the invention of the printing press to the present day.

Western nations suffer from severe social problems, rising populism and
declining trust. These problems did not come from nowhere: they have roots in
the dramatic cultural changes of the late twentieth century. To understand them,
we must rethink our own history. The West did not just develop good institutions
and economic growth: it also created a uniquely powerful culture. By reanalysing
the rise of the West through a cultural prism, using ideas from the new science
of cultural evolution, **Wyclif's Dust** shows where modern liberalism went wrong, 
and how to repair it.

Along the way, you’ll learn why you can tell your kids anything and be
believed; which U2 song Bono described as “just a load of vowel sounds ganging
up on a great man”; what the Ancient Egyptian Onomasticon of Amenope taught its
readers; how the Swedes learned to read; just how drunk people were in
17th-century Shropshire; why Frederick of Prussia thought of himself as “God’s
administrator”; how Charles James Fox dived into a bowl of cream; why Baron von
Haynau was chased down a London high street by draymen; how many seconds it
should take you to open or close a file drawer; the unprintable things the Wolf
Man wanted to do to Sigmund Freud; why modern Norwegians “don’t like to get
fish goo in their hair”; why social media is a BUMMER; and what happened to the
unused confetti from Hilary Clinton’s election night in 2016.

Using ideas from the new science of cultural evolution, Wyclif’s Dust takes you
on a journey from our shared past, through our conflict-ridden present, to our
future.
