Excerpt from Chapter Two: The coming of print religion
============================

Although some groups such as Jews were able to specialize in literacy to
a great degree, before the printing press, literacy was confined to
relatively few out of all of European society, and could play only a
limited coordinating role. The invention of the printing press changed
this dramatically. Books became much cheaper and could be mass-produced.
We know that this transformed Western societies. But how exactly? You
may think the story goes like this. There was a massive expansion in
written knowledge, and an explosion of technical and scientific printed
output, and a slower increase in literacy, as more and more people were
able to take advantage of these newly available treasures. The resulting
increase in knowledge transformed society.[^1]

In the very long run, this is about right. But it misses something
important. After Gutenberg, there is certainly an explosion in writing.
Over the fifteenth century, Western Europe produced about 5 million
manuscripts in total; in the next fifty years alone, 80 million printed
books were produced, and for the eighteenth century the figure is a
billion. But the most common topic of these books is not science,
engineering, household management or farming advice. It is religion. A
few statistics will give the flavour. 45% of Italian incunabula the
earliest printed books were on religious topics. In England, about 40%
of the editions published from 1480-1640 were religious by far the
largest category. Across Europe, 35% of all editions between 1454 and
1600 were on religious topics.[^2]

It takes a little thought to see how extraordinary that is. It is clear
that the expense of print was a tightly binding constraint on the growth
and transmission of knowledge. The printing press loosened that
constraint. But technical knowledge is not what the press was most used
for. This was not due to repression by rulers: the surge in religious
publication was driven by popular demand. In 1530, there were 64,000
clandestine copies of Tyndale's New Testament in England, at a time when
owning it was illegal. By contrast, Galileo's epoch-making *New Science*
was a rare edition, which interested only a tiny group of specialists.
Why read the Bible when you are desperately short of many more practical
kinds of knowledge? To answer that question, we must look at how print
helped to create new religious forms and practices.[^3] I will give
these the name *print religion.*

These were not just changes in practice. New denominations and groups
formed to support and spread the new form of religion: first the
Lutherans in Germany and Northern Europe, then the Calvinists of Geneva,
Holland, and Britain, as well as new groups within Catholicism, like the
Jesuits and later the Jansenists. These groups developed collective
practices and institutions to reinforce the individual transformation
they were aiming at. New ways of acting and thinking often challenge
existing institutions, especially religious institutions, whose power is
closely tied to specific beliefs; so the new groups also inevitably
became political actors, supporting their interests in conflicts with
the status quo powers, which often became violent. The print religion
*par excellence* was Protestantism, and the link between Protestantism
and the printing press was celebrated by the first reformers Luther
described the press as "God's highest and ultimate gift of grace" and
has been discussed ever since. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to
identify the new religious practices with any one of these groups, or
with any specific religious beliefs. The Protestant reforms engendered a
Catholic response, the counter-reformation or Catholic reformation,
which was in many ways parallel, so much that some modern historians
describe both reformation and counter-reformation as a single process of
"confessionalization". Indeed, some key parts of print religion, for
example inward self-examination and methodical spiritual exercises, were
arguably first developed within the counter-reformation, and catalyzed
Protestant responses. In short, Protestantism, Calvinism, and
Catholicism all contributed to the development of print religion. This
does not imply that all forms of print religion were the same: as we
will see, there are substantial differences between different countries
in the nature of print religion, its relationship with the political
authorities, and its effects on society.[^4]

But they did share some characteristics in common. First, religious
reading, self-examination and self-discipline were central to the life
of the believer. Second, religious groups were organized to support this
transformed lifestyle, and developed institutions for this purpose both
teaching institutions, and enforcement institutions. Third, these
religious groups were deeply woven into the lives of their adherents,
providing a basis for new economic and social relationships, and to
varying degrees becoming a source of social power and creating new
collective actors; we shall see below how this changed the politics of
the era.

### The new life of the believer

The shortest definition of print religion is "book religion for
everybody". Print religion extended the close engagement of the Catholic
priest with the Bible, or the *hafiz* with the Quran, to all adherents.
The Lutheran idea of the priesthood of all believers was more than a
theological concept: it was a description of how the new religion was
meant to work. The new practices of religious life included individual
study and devotion, solitary reading, prayer, meditation and
diary-writing; and family reading, prayer and discussion. There were
precedents for many of these practices before printing, for example in
the Catholic movement called the *devotio moderna*. But it was printing
that, by making rulebooks and manuals available to many more people, let
these practices become widespread.[^5]

I will take most of my examples from English (and New England)
Puritanism. This is partly because Puritanism has generated a uniquely
large and fruitful historical literature, but also because Puritanism
was influential across Protestant Europe. For instance, the translation
of Puritan devotional literature into German strongly influenced the
Pietist movement of the 17th and 18th centuries, which in turn was taken
up by the nascent Prussian state; later Pietism returned the favour by
influencing 18th-century Methodism. Puritan works were also widely
received in Holland. On the Catholic side, the deep focus on the state
of the believer's soul and on practices to guide it can be found in
various Catholic movements, including the Jesuits, who practiced a
quasi-military form of spiritual discipline, and the French quietists.
Jesuit and counter-reformation thought may have influenced the English
Puritans.[^6]

Reading was not just a way the new practices spread, it was a key
practice itself. "To reade the word, and to meditate thereon, is a daily
part of a Christian holy life," said the New England Puritan John
Cotton. The most important text was of course the Bible, but this was
supplemented by a whole literature on self-improvement. Some works were
on nearly as many bookshelves as the Bible itself, and remained there
for centuries: in English, *Foxe's Book of Martyrs*, the *Whole Duty of
Man* and later *Pilgrim's Progress*; in Germany, the anonymous
*Theologia Germanica* and Johann Arndt's *Das Wahre Christentum* ("True
Christianity"), which was popular throughout Protestant Europe. The
private reading encouraged by Protestants could be highly methodical and
intellectual. In his text for preachers *The Art of Prophesying*, the
Puritan William Perkins recommended cataloguing-style techniques for
bible study, using a commonplace book: "divide the right-hand pages of
your book into columns\... Head each of these pages with a major
topic\...". He also suggested creating an alphabetical index for ease of
reference. Devotional manuals laid down rules for reading, including
making it part of one's daily routine and avoiding wandering thoughts,
and provided model prayers to be said before reading. But reading was
not just an intellectual activity: the Bible was to be read and
meditated upon, and manuals suggested visualization techniques like
imagining Christ on the cross to bring the message home. [^7]

Many people also wrote. In particular, diary-writing and autobiography
were designed to chart the individual's daily progress to salvation.
They allowed for self-examination, both spiritual and practical: "I
spoke two unadvised Words to Day\.... I was too forgetful of God, and
extending in Tobacco," wrote one New England diarist. Nightly diaries
could be a form of accounting, recording how one had spent one's time in
the day, perhaps including a list of the sins one had committed. Later,
these diaries might be worked up into spiritual autobiographies,
narrating the believer's religious experience for the benefit of
others.[^8]

Typically, prayer might refer back to earlier reading of the Bible, or
heard sermons. People prayed both individually, often seeking out
solitary places or retiring to their bedchamber, and collectively in the
family. Prayer was linked to meditation both internal monologue, and
visualization on Biblical themes. More generally, meditation meant
focusing on one's own mental state. Don't think of modern Buddhism: this
focus was vigilant and critical. The aim was to notice, and repent of,
one's sins in thought, word and deed, and the long-term goal was to
transform the self, not accept it. Believers must "learne to force our
natures"; to "rule and beare sway even as Kings over our owne thoughts,
wils, affections, over-mastering them". This was supplemented with the
help of a large number of rules of life, derived from the Bible but
applied to the context of early modern life. One believer levied fines
on himself for breaking them, putting money into a personal poor box a
practice which survives in the "swear box". Some self-improvement books
provided a daily schedule to keep to; over the week, the Sunday rest
provided a full stop for disciplined reflection. [^9]

These practices brought a new level of introspection to people's
consciousness, an awareness of and focus on the state of one's soul.
Philosophers sometimes call this "interiority". I will use the word
*inwardness*.[^10] Inwardness means being aware of one's own
consciousness, including one's beliefs and thoughts. This is a
fundamental capability of human psychology. At the same time, it is
partly a cultural achievement. This is true in two ways. First,
introspection was pursued by members of the new religions because their
beliefs encouraged it. Second, the practice of inwardness was made
easier, even made possible in some ways, by the technology of the book
and literacy. For writing helps individuals to fix their beliefs, that
is, to map their shifting mental states to a clear set of propositions.
This is not a natural ability, and there is no single, "natural" way to
perform the mapping. In the course of an hour, I may have many thoughts,
even many which are articulated in language, but not all of these will
qualify as beliefs. To some extent my beliefs are chosen. One can even
argue that the need to choose what to write down helps to produce, or
clarify, the phenomenon of belief itself. A belief is more than a
passing thought: it is a proposition one endorses and is prepared to
defend. Endorsing and arguing for beliefs are social practices, and the
way these have been done in the West is linked to the practice of
writing. Because print helped to turn reading and writing from a rare,
specialized skill into a central plank of social organization, it also
helped to spread the practices of inwardness; and as the practices
spread, they elaborated.

It is worth considering at the broadest level why the practice of
inwardness matters. The solitary thinker can do two things: first, he
may compare his current thoughts with his past ideas, testing and
adjusting them for mutual coherence. Doing so makes sure that beliefs
and fundamental commitments persist within the individual's psychology
sometimes, also, that they are revised in the light of new ideas and new
evidence. Second, especially when he has access to ideas recorded in
writing, he may do the same testing and adjusting with the ideas of
other people from the past.

These practices provide an anchor for society. Communication between
individuals can share ideas, develop consensus and strengthen norms,
allowing a group of present individuals to reach a collective decision
about what to do. But to be successful in the long run, communities must
also be able to retain their identity and purposes through time. This
means not just developing consensus, but also breaking an existing
consensus when times have changed, or when existing practices and
beliefs have declined from the original ideals, perhaps under the
pressure of self-interest. The ability to challenge society's current
practice and intellectual consensus, in the name of its deeper long-run
commitments, is what allows continuity of purpose through the changes of
history. Such challenges are present in many of the steps forward made
by our societies, such as the long campaign by religiously-motivated
reformers to end the Transatlantic slave trade.

Inwardness, then, is a fundamental part of our mental furniture, which
is nevertheless a historical achievement. This alone makes it important.
As we will see below, it also plays a role in the development of one of
the central facts of modern democratic politics: public opinion.
