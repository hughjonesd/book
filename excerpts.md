> A society can solve small problems by thinking about them. 
> When societies have big problems, the way they are thinking about them is
> often itself part of the problem. In this case, deep and radical rethinking of
> widely held assumptions is needed before the problems can be tackled right....
> I wrote this book because I believe our current problems in the West 
> are of this kind. They require the intellectual equivalent of major surgery.
